## Introduction to Executors

Executors are a high-level abstraction for working with threads in Java. They provide a way to decouple task submission from task execution, allowing developers to focus on what needs to be done rather than the mechanics of thread creation, management, and scheduling.

The `java.util.concurrent` package provides several executor implementations through the `Executors` factory class. Each type of executor is designed for specific use cases and has different characteristics regarding thread creation, reuse, and task queuing.

## Single Thread Executor

### How It Works

A Single Thread Executor creates a single worker thread to process tasks from an unbounded queue. Tasks are guaranteed to execute sequentially in the order they are submitted.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
```

### Key Characteristics

- Uses exactly one thread to execute tasks
- Tasks are processed sequentially (one after another)
- If the thread terminates due to a failure during execution, a new one will be created to replace it
- Tasks are stored in an unbounded LinkedBlockingQueue

### Typical Use Cases

- When tasks must be executed in a specific order
- When you need to ensure that tasks don't execute concurrently
- For thread-unsafe operations that require sequential access
- For simple background tasks that don't require parallelism

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
- Simplifies thread management
- Guarantees sequential execution
- Prevents race conditions between tasks

**Limitations:**
- Limited throughput (only one task at a time)
- Potential for unbounded queue growth if tasks are submitted faster than they can be processed

### Example

See [SingleThreadExecutorDemo.java](../src/main/java/com/sandbox/executors/SingleThreadExecutorDemo.java) for a complete example of how to use a Single Thread Executor.

## Fixed Thread Pool

### How It Works

A Fixed Thread Pool creates a specified number of worker threads that remain in the pool throughout its lifetime. Tasks are submitted to a queue and executed as threads become available.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(nThreads);
```

### Key Characteristics

- Creates a thread pool with a fixed number of threads
- Threads remain in the pool until it is explicitly shut down
- If a thread terminates due to a failure, a new one will be created to replace it
- Tasks are stored in an unbounded LinkedBlockingQueue

### Typical Use Cases

- CPU-intensive applications where you want to limit the number of concurrent threads to the number of available processors
- Applications that need to limit resource usage
- Server applications that need to handle a predictable number of concurrent requests
- Batch processing operations

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
- Controls the maximum number of concurrent threads
- Reuses threads, reducing the overhead of thread creation
- Provides predictable resource usage

**Limitations:**
- Fixed capacity can lead to underutilization if threads are blocked
- Potential for unbounded queue growth if tasks are submitted faster than they can be processed

### Example

See [FixedThreadPoolDemo.java](../src/main/java/com/sandbox/executors/FixedThreadPoolDemo.java) for a complete example of how to use a Fixed Thread Pool.

## Cached Thread Pool

### How It Works

A Cached Thread Pool creates new threads as needed but reuses previously constructed threads when they become available. Threads that remain idle for 60 seconds are terminated and removed from the pool.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
```

### Key Characteristics

- Creates new threads as needed
- Reuses previously constructed threads when available
- Threads that remain idle for 60 seconds are terminated and removed from the cache
- Can grow unbounded if all threads are busy and new tasks are submitted
- Uses a SynchronousQueue (direct handoff) with no capacity

### Typical Use Cases

- Applications with many short-lived tasks
- Systems with unpredictable or bursty workloads
- When the number of concurrent tasks can vary significantly
- For improving the performance of programs that execute many asynchronous tasks

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
- Efficient for executing many short-lived tasks
- Automatically adjusts the thread pool size based on workload
- Reduces latency since there's no queuing when threads are available

**Limitations:**
- Can create too many threads if tasks are long-running or submitted faster than they complete
- Potential for resource exhaustion in high-load situations due to unbounded thread creation
- No control over the maximum number of threads

### Example

See [CachedThreadPoolDemo.java](../src/main/java/com/sandbox/executors/CachedThreadPoolDemo.java) for a complete example of how to use a Cached Thread Pool.

## Scheduled Thread Pool

### How It Works

A Scheduled Thread Pool creates a fixed-size thread pool that can schedule tasks to run after a given delay or to execute periodically.

```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(corePoolSize);
```

### Key Characteristics

- Creates a thread pool with a specified number of threads
- Can schedule tasks to run once after a delay
- Can schedule tasks to run periodically at a fixed rate or with a fixed delay between executions
- Uses a DelayedWorkQueue to hold scheduled tasks

### Scheduling Methods

1. **schedule(Runnable, delay, TimeUnit)** - Executes a task once after the specified delay
2. **scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable, initialDelay, period, TimeUnit)** - Executes a task repeatedly at a fixed rate, regardless of how long each task takes
3. **scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable, initialDelay, delay, TimeUnit)** - Executes a task repeatedly with a fixed delay between the end of one execution and the start of the next

### Typical Use Cases

- Running maintenance tasks at fixed intervals
- Implementing timeouts
- Polling resources periodically
- Scheduling recurring jobs (like cleanup tasks, refreshing caches)
- Implementing retry mechanisms with increasing delays

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
- Provides sophisticated scheduling capabilities
- Supports both one-time delayed execution and recurring tasks
- Allows for task cancellation

**Limitations:**
- Fixed thread pool size might not be optimal for all scheduling scenarios
- Tasks that take longer than their period will stack up if using scheduleAtFixedRate

### Example

See [ScheduledThreadPoolDemo.java](../src/main/java/com/sandbox/executors/ScheduledThreadPoolDemo.java) for a complete example of how to use a Scheduled Thread Pool.

## Comparison of Executor Types

| Executor Type | Thread Creation | Thread Reuse | Queue Type | Task Ordering | Use Case |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| Single Thread | One thread only | Reuses the single thread | Unbounded LinkedBlockingQueue | Sequential (FIFO) | Sequential processing, maintaining order |
| Fixed Thread Pool | Fixed number | Reuses all threads | Unbounded LinkedBlockingQueue | Concurrent with FIFO queue | Limiting concurrent threads, CPU-intensive tasks |
| Cached Thread Pool | As needed | Reuses idle threads | SynchronousQueue (direct handoff) | No guaranteed order | Many short-lived tasks, variable load |
| Scheduled Thread Pool | Fixed number | Reuses all threads | DelayedWorkQueue | Time-based priority | Delayed or periodic tasks |

## Best Practices

1. **Always shut down executors properly**:
   - First call `shutdown()` to reject new tasks
   - Then wait for existing tasks to terminate using `awaitTermination(timeout, TimeUnit)`
   - If tasks don't terminate in time, call `shutdownNow()` to cancel running tasks
   - Handle InterruptedException by calling `shutdownNow()` and preserving interrupt status

2. **Choose the right executor for your use case**:
   - Use SingleThreadExecutor when tasks must execute sequentially
   - Use FixedThreadPool when you need to limit concurrent threads
   - Use CachedThreadPool for many short-lived tasks
   - Use ScheduledThreadPool for delayed or periodic tasks

3. **Be careful with unbounded queues**:
   - Fixed and Single Thread executors use unbounded queues which can lead to OutOfMemoryError if tasks are submitted faster than they can be processed

4. **Consider using custom thread factories**:
   - For better thread naming, priority setting, or making threads daemon

5. **Handle rejected executions**:
   - Provide a RejectedExecutionHandler to handle tasks that cannot be accepted for execution

6. **Consider using CompletableFuture with executors** for more complex asynchronous operations and composition.

## Thread Pool Sizing

Determining the optimal size for a thread pool is crucial for achieving maximum performance and resource utilization. Here are key metrics and considerations for deciding the appropriate thread pool size:

### Theoretical Foundation: Little's Law

Little's Law provides a mathematical foundation for thread pool sizing:

```
N = X Ã— R
```

Where:
- N = Number of concurrent threads (thread pool size)
- X = Throughput (tasks per second)
- R = Response time (seconds per task)

This formula helps establish a relationship between concurrency, throughput, and response time.

### CPU-Bound vs. IO-Bound Tasks

The optimal thread pool size depends significantly on the nature of your tasks:

#### For CPU-Bound Tasks

CPU-bound tasks spend most of their time using the CPU (calculations, data processing, etc.). For these tasks:

```
Optimal thread pool size = Number of CPU cores
```

or slightly higher:

```
Optimal thread pool size = Number of CPU cores + 1
```

The extra thread can help keep the CPU busy during thread scheduling overhead.

#### For IO-Bound Tasks

IO-bound tasks spend most of their time waiting for external resources (disk, network, database, etc.). For these tasks:

```
Optimal thread pool size = Number of CPU cores Ã— (1 + Wait time / Service time)
```

Where:
- Wait time = Time spent waiting for IO
- Service time = Time spent processing data

For heavily IO-bound tasks, this can result in a much larger thread pool size than the number of CPU cores.

### Practical Guidelines

1. **Start with a baseline**:
   - For CPU-bound tasks: Use `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()` to get the number of available cores
   - For mixed workloads: Start with 2 Ã— number of CPU cores

2. **Monitor and adjust**:
   - Track CPU utilization, memory usage, response times, and throughput
   - If CPU utilization is low but response times are high, consider increasing the pool size
   - If CPU utilization is high and response times are increasing, consider reducing the pool size

3. **Consider system resources**:
   - Each thread consumes memory (typically 1MB stack size by default in Java)
   - Thread context switching adds overhead
   - Thread creation and destruction are expensive operations

4. **Use thread pool tuning formulas**:
   - Brian Goetz's formula: `Number of threads = Number of Available Cores / (1 - Blocking Coefficient)`
   - Where the blocking coefficient is between 0 and 1, representing the fraction of time threads are blocked

5. **Implement adaptive sizing**:
   - For production systems with varying loads, consider using ThreadPoolExecutor's constructor parameters:
     - corePoolSize: Minimum number of threads to keep alive
     - maximumPoolSize: Maximum number of threads allowed
     - keepAliveTime: Time to keep idle threads alive beyond corePoolSize

### Common Anti-Patterns

1. **Too many threads**: Leads to excessive context switching, memory consumption, and potentially thread starvation
2. **Too few threads**: Results in underutilization of CPU resources and increased response times
3. **One-size-fits-all approach**: Different applications and workloads require different thread pool configurations

### Example: Custom ThreadPoolExecutor with Optimal Sizing

```java
int cpuCores = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
double blockingCoefficient = 0.9; // Example: 90% of time is spent waiting
int poolSize = (int)(cpuCores / (1 - blockingCoefficient));

ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    cpuCores,                 // Core pool size
    poolSize,                 // Maximum pool size
    60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS,    // Keep-alive time
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>(1000),  // Work queue with bounded capacity
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy() // Rejection policy
);
```

## Finally Block vs Try-With-Resources

In our executor examples, we use a `finally` block for shutting down executors rather than Java's try-with-resources statement. Here's why:

### Why Not Use Try-With-Resources?

While `ExecutorService` does implement `AutoCloseable` (since Java 19), there are several reasons to prefer explicit shutdown in a `finally` block:

1. **Controlled Shutdown Process**: The `close()` method on `ExecutorService` (added in Java 19) simply calls `shutdownNow()`, which forcefully interrupts running tasks. Our two-phase shutdown approach is more graceful:
   - First attempt a normal shutdown with `shutdown()`
   - Wait for tasks to complete with `awaitTermination()`
   - Only if that fails, resort to `shutdownNow()`

2. **Backward Compatibility**: For Java versions prior to 19, `ExecutorService` didn't implement `AutoCloseable`, making try-with-resources unavailable.

3. **Error Handling**: Our approach provides better error handling by:
   - Preserving and resetting interrupt status
   - Logging when executors fail to terminate
   - Providing a second chance for tasks to respond to interruption

4. **Customization**: The explicit shutdown pattern allows for customization of shutdown behavior, such as:
   - Configurable timeout periods
   - Different strategies for handling tasks that don't terminate
   - Specific logging or monitoring during shutdown

### Example of Proper Shutdown Pattern

The pattern used in our examples follows this structure:

1. Create the executor service
2. Use a try-finally block to ensure proper shutdown
3. In the finally block, call our custom shutdown method

This approach ensures that resources are properly released even if exceptions occur during task execution.
